logic 


1. for each question
1.1. identify the adjectives , adverbs and verbs
1.2  score each of the sentences based on whether they have the exact adjective /  adverb and verbs . adjectives have more weight than the adverbs and verbs.  
1.2  get the sentence which gets the maximum score. if there is a conflict, resolve it by the "substring" matching mechanism. lets call this sentence as S1. 
1.3  indentify those answer(s) from the "available" answers list, which are a substring of the string S1. (i.e part of that sentence). lets call this as A[]
1.4  if A[] has more then one answer, then got to 1.4.1 else go to 1.4.2 
1.4.1 conflict has to be resolved using nearest-to-word-pattern weightage mechanism for the adjectives , adverbs and verbs. 
1.4.2 if A[] has only one answer then, use that as the match and process the next question. IF A[] is empty then go to 1.4.3
1.4.3 use the substring matching mechanism to find a match.

Sentence 1 --> Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 â€“ October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman, who has been described as America's greatest inventor. 

Sentence 2 --> He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long
-lasting, practical electric light bulb. 

Sentence 3 --> Dubbed "The Wizard of Menlo Park", he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.

************************************************************************************************************************************
Q1. Who is described as America's greatest inventor?
is -VBZ : be
described -VBN : describe

"describe" is there only in sentence 1, so its the only match. 
Among the answers only "a5" comes from sentence 1, so "a5" is the match for "Q1".

************************************************************************************************************************************

Q2. Which devices developed by Edison greatly influenced life around the world?
developed -VBN : develop
greatly -RB : greatly
influenced -VBD : influence

weightage score to be calculated as there is a tie btw 1 and 4 as both 1 and 4 are from the same sentence which has been identified as a match. 
whats the starting and end index for each of the conflicting answers ? 
a1 - 22 (a1s) (start index) ; 25 (end index) (a1e)
a4 - 13 (a4s) (startd index) ; 25 (end-index) (a4e)

adjective and adverbs 
---------------------
"greatly" - index is 6 (q1s) . 
scoreForA1 = (a1s - q1s)*w1 =  (22-6)*w1 = 16*w1
scoreForA4 = (a4s - q1s)*w1 =  (13-6)*w1 = 7*w1

verbs
-----
developed - index is 2 (q2s)
scoreForA1 = (a1s - q2s)*w2 =  (22-2)*w1 = 20*w2
scoreForA4 = (a4s - q2s)*w2 =  (13-2)*w1 = 11*w2

influenced - index is 7 (q3s)
scoreForA1 = (a1s - q3s)*w2 =  (22-7)*w1 = 15*w2
scoreForA4 = (a4s - q3s)*w2 =  (13-7)*w1 = 6*w2

overall  "scoreForA4" is much lesser than "scoreForA1" , so "a4" is deemeed as a better match

************************************************************************************************************************************

Q3: What is Edison often credited with?
often -RB : often
credited -VBD : credit

Sentence 3 is the match 
But There is a conflict btw answers a2 and a3
weightage score to be calculated as there is a tie btw 2 and 3 as both 2 and 3 are from the same sentence which has been identified as a match. 
whats the starting and end index for each of the conflicting answers ? 
a2 - 1 (a2s) (start index) ; 6 (end index) (a2e)
a3 - 32 (a3s) (startd index) ; 45 (end-index) (a3e)

adjective and adverbs 
---------------------
"often"  - index is 34 (q1s)
scoreForA2 = (a2s - q1s)*w1 =  (1-34)*w1 = -33*w1
scoreForA3 = (a3s - q1s)*w1 =  (32-34)*w1 = -2*w1

verbs
------
credited  - index is 35 (q2s)
scoreForA2 = (a2s - q2s)*w1 =  (1-35)*w1 = -34*w1
scoreForA3 = (a3s - q2s)*w1 =  (32-35)*w1 = -3*w1


overall  "scoreForA3" is much lesser than "scoreForA2" , so "A3" is deemeed as a better match

************************************************************************************************************************************

Q4. What was the long-lasting thing which Edison developed?
long-lasting -JJ : long-lasting
developed -VBD : develop


Sentence 2 is the match as only that has both the two words (adjective / adverb) listed 

both a1 and a4 are from sentence 2. 
but a4 is already matched to Q2, so only a1 is available for match and hence no conflict. So A1 is the best match for Q4. 

************************************************************************************************************************************

Q5. What was Edison dubbed as?
dubbed -VBD : dub

Sentence 3 is the only match. 
but both a2 and a3 are from sentence 2. 
but a3 is already matched to Q3, so only a1 is available for match and hence no conflict. So A2 is the best match for Q5.
